    "As of 2018, 30.3 million U.S. adults are diagnosed with heart disease. Heart disease is a group of conditions that affect the structure or function of the heart. The four most common types of heart disease are coronary artery disease, heart valve disease, heart failure, and arrhythmia. This project aims to predict a person's likelihood of getting heart disease using the attributes, age, sex, cholesterol level, blood sugar level, chest pain, and resting blood pressure. The project will produce a predictor that has been trained with multiple folds of data so that it can accurately predict a person’s likelihood of getting heart disease. The data set given to us is from the Cleveland database primarily focuses on 14 attributes: age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest,  number of major vessels, thal, and diagnosis of heart disease."
